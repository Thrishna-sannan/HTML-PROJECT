    <h3>Indroduction</h3>
    <p>Personal alarms, sometimes called ‘telecare’ are devices that can call for help if you or a loved one has an accident, medical emergency, or security concern at home.
         They can alert a wide range of people to help you  from a family member or friend, to a care team, or the emergency services.
         Personal alarms emit a loud, attention-grabbing sound when it activated.This loud noise can help to scare away or attract attention from those nearby. 
          Personal alarms are becoming increasingly popular for women who need an extra layer of safety and security when traveling alone.
           The alarm helps to alert people in the vicinity if a situation poses a potential danger, and can act as a deterrent to would-be perpetrators.
            Some believe personal alarms to be an effective safety measure, while others caution against relying too heavily on these gadgets due to potential drawbacks.</p>
